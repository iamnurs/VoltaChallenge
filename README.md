**NOTE#1**: API key for google map is no longer active. To launch, please, add your own API key for google maps to ```android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml```

**NOTE#2**: App was not tested on IOS, because I did not have access to any Apple product. Please run it on Android emulator, I guess on IOS it will not even open
